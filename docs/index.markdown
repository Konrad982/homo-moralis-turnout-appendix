We provide a link to the GitHub repository that includes the code for the graphics that are included in the paper. We also provide links to interactive plots comparing two families of benefit functions and showing consistent strategies for a wide range of model parameters in our partisan case.

## Code for the graphics
The code for generating the graphics in the paper as well as for the interactive plots cited below can be found here: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Konrad982/homo-moralis-turnout)

## Interactive plots
The interactive consistent strategies plot for the partisan case with uniform cost can be found here: [Heroku App for Uniform Cost](https://homo-moralis-interactive-tool-005ed7c008c4.herokuapp.com/ex_post_vis_uniform)

The interactive consistent strategies plot for the partisan case with other-than-uniform cost can be found here: [Heroku App for Other Cost](https://homo-moralis-interactive-tool-005ed7c008c4.herokuapp.com/ex_post_vis_other_cost)

An interactive plot comparing two parametric families of benefit functions can be found here: [Heroku App for Benefit Functions](https://homo-moralis-interactive-tool-005ed7c008c4.herokuapp.com/arctan_vs_gamma)
