# Online Appendix

We provide links to the GitHub repositories that include the code for the graphics that are included in the paper. We also provide a link to an interactive plot for our partisan case.

## Code for the graphics
The code for generating the graphics and the interactive plots can be found here: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Konrad982/homo-moralis-turnout)

## Interactive plots
The interactive best-response (consistent strategies) plot for the partisan case with uniform cost can be found here: [Heroku app for Uniform Cost](https://homo-moralis-interactive-tool-005ed7c008c4.herokuapp.com/ex_post_vis_uniform)

The interactive best-response (consistent strategies) plot for the partisan case with other-than-uniform cost can be found here: [Heroku app for Other Cost](https://homo-moralis-interactive-tool-005ed7c008c4.herokuapp.com/ex_post_vis_other_cost)

An interactive plot comparing two parametric families of benefit functions can be found here: [Heroku app for Benefit Functions](https://homo-moralis-interactive-tool-005ed7c008c4.herokuapp.com/arctan_vs_gamma)
